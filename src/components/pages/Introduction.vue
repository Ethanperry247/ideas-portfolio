                    Three themes which have followed me for as long as I can remember. 
                    Life is the medium in which I seek to achieve the balance between them.
                    If only it were easy, but that would defeat the point.

                        <em>Curious.</em>
                        <br><br>
                        I didn’t know what to expect. Those closest to me followed down the hallway as I walked through the door to my new room. It was empty, and a thin layer of dust lay delicately across the barren furniture. Nervousness pervaded me, and I couldn’t fully discover or decide why. I thought I should embrace it though--college was a new frontier, and I knew I needed to take it with open arms. Beginning to unload my things, I bumped into some new roommates. We greeted, chatted for a while, and then I got back to setting up my new room. I still couldn’t shake that new feeling and surprise that I would be living with these people--people my own age and attending my same classes. Once again, I felt nervous, but also excited in anticipation of this new transition.
                        <br><br>
                        As I arrived at my first classes, curiosity filled me to the brim. I felt ambitious and ready to get going with the new material, as the suspense for these classes had been building throughout the summer. I knew for a fact that things would be different but figured it couldn’t be much more difficult than high school. Walking out of class, I felt confident that I could succeed, maybe even take on a little more than what I was currently signed up for. 
                        <br><br>
                        Shortly after those first few classes, I began to get more involved. After attending the Celebration of Mines, I had put my name on more than a handful of club email lists. Everything seemed so interesting and I wish I could do it all, but I figured that I would try some clubs out and then narrow down my choices. I had a good feeling--the college transition was going smoothly, and I felt at home.
                        <br><br>
                        <em>Pushing the Boundary.</em>
                        <br><br>
                        Walking out of the meeting, I was ecstatic. I had dreamed of working on a research project for a long time, and I would finally have the chance to do so. A thought lurked in the background though: I had signed up for that additional class my advisor recommended, and I had taken up the offer of an independent study a few days earlier. Was I perhaps biting off more than I could chew? I was torn. I desperately wanted to excel with my academic work, but I also wanted to join more extracurriculars and have time to hang out with friends. I figured that I’d find some time in my schedule to fit it in, and if all else fails, I would just have to put in a few more hours over the weekend. The forms were due the next day though, so I understood that I needed to step on the pedal and find a research advisor. A pressure built in my chest--I had a lot to get done over the next few days. I tried to ignore the feeling.

                        <em>Overwhelmed.</em>
                        <br><br>
                        Slumped over my desk, I stared at my planner before me. The page was crammed with little To-Dos and notes about what was coming up. I felt like crying--there was hardly a moment to enjoy or even breathe. How could this be what my decisions came to? Was I being too ambitious? I hated it--I had almost no free time, and no time to spend with my friends. I could hear people laughing in the hallway and the feeling that came to me was not happiness but annoyance; and so, I shut my door for the first time, but not the last. It was only a metaphor for the person I was turning into--closing off and pushing away those around me, then further putting on a facade, as if I was happy and fulfilled. But inside, the feeling was all too different.
                        <br><br>
                        Time started to pass much more quickly. Almost robotically, I went through the motions of my daily routine--rise and grind. Was this the way college was supposed to go? I felt ashamed of the way things were.
                        <br><br>
                        <em>New Beginnings?</em>
                        <br><br>
                        I knew that something needed to change. Noticing that I was beginning to lose interest in school, my clubs and activities, and even the conversations I had with others, it struck me how unhealthy my lifestyle had become. I had turned my environment and experience into exactly the opposite of what I had intended it to be, and even worse, I started to become an entirely different person.
                        <br><br>
                        Above all, I needed to change my expectations. I wanted to get the most out of college, but heading into it, I had the wrong idea of what “the most” was supposed to be. I was focused on my academics solely and entirely, when perhaps I forgot the new and foreign place that college was. Nobody can navigate this journey without companions, and I was alone and in the dark. 
                        <br><br>
                        So I consulted those closest to me--the friends, roommates, and family members who helped me transition into this new world in the first place. They too had noticed the ways in which I had changed, and they were disheartened to see the place I was in. They helped me discover the way out and were there for me when I needed them most. It was a new beginning for me, and this time, I knew what I needed to change. Though these were hard times, they were also the greatest learning experiences I’ve ever had. Not the kind of learning that one experiences in school, but the kind that teaches one how to live.
