                            You have reached the end of my experience. A year which, though at times felt as though it would never end, flew by in less than the blink of an eye. It has challenged me in a way I never expected, though I couldn’t be more glad of the companions and learning I found in it.
                            <br><br>
                            To be honest, I didn’t know what to expect when first entering this class. With the artistic expectations of the honors application and description of the class itself, I was nervous--I’ve never considered myself to be at all proficient at hand drawings, and to that same effect, I’ve never considered myself to be much of a creative person. However, what I found in this class was much different: the curriculum, teachers, and assignments were inviting to my newness and nervousness. Rather than feeling beat down, I felt empowered as I completed assignments, learned new skills, and made new connections. IDEAS, above all, blew my expectations out of the water, challenged me in my creative process, and pushed me to break the boundaries of which I thought I was constrained by.

                            In this class, I have discovered that I am a fanatic of ethics, of interdisciplinary design, and of critical and creative thinking. I hope that I may have the privilege to leverage these tools in my life and future career, both at School of Mines and beyond. Perhaps another thing that surprised me about this course was its applications to my other classes. I have already utilized my newly learned skills in a number of courses, and I expect to use them exhaustively throughout the future.

                            However, skills and thinking processes were not all that I took out of IDEAS. I have also made new connections of which I never expected to make in the first place. These connections are with teachers, TAs, and of course, my peers in the class, and without their mentorship and companionship, I don’t think I would have had nearly the success in or enjoyment of this course. For these people, I am grateful, and I hope that I may continue to maintain my connections with them throughout my future at Mines.

                            In IDEAS, I have discovered much about myself and the world around me, and I feel that my perspective has grown and morphed into something entirely different from before. When I think about problems, I ponder the tethers and connections to their surrounding systems. When I think about solutions, I consider the impact they may have, and whether or not they are helpful and truly the answer to a problem. When I am making a design choice, I seek the critical point between science, art, design, ethics, and morals. Most importantly, I embrace big, ugly, and complicated problems with open arms. The toolkit I have developed throughout this course enables me to champion those problems, and I know it will be used far beyond this class.

                            I hope that you enjoyed my portfolio as much as I enjoyed creating it. I have never taken up such an ambitious coding project as this one, but above all, I wanted it to be a demonstration of the skills and tools I have learned throughout this year, both in IDEAS and beyond. Thanks for visiting, and again, I hope you enjoyed!
